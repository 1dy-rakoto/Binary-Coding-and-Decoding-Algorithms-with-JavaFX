# Binary Coding and Decoding Algorithms with JavaFX

This repository contains a desktop software developed using JavaFX that implements various coding and decoding algorithms for binary data. The implemented algorithms include Hamming coding, simple parity coding, interleaved parity coding, and repetition parity coding. 

## Features
- **Hamming Coding**: Implements the Hamming coding algorithm for error detection and correction in binary data.
- **Simple Parity**: Implements the simple parity algorithm for error detection in binary data.
- **Interleaved Parity**: Implements the interleaved parity algorithm for error detection in binary data.
- **Repetition Parity**: Implements the repetition parity algorithm for error detection in binary data.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse,netbeans).

3. Build and run the project to launch the desktop software.

4. Use the software's intuitive user interface to enter binary data and choose the desired coding or decoding algorithm.

5. View the encoded or decoded binary output in the software's interface.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- JavaFX library
